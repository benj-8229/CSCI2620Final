Get boids performant enough to render live to a web page
Need to have high enough FPS to render at least 60 FPS, after dealing with overhead

Currently at 16-18 fps on a 150x150 grid with 50 boids. Should be pushing far higher and faster than this.

Order of priority for performance benefits
1. Vectorize Boid operations
	1.a. Distance calculations take by far the longest, n^2 sqrt calculations per frame. Distance compute accounts for ~83% of runtime
	1.b. Calculations like "average velocity", "average heading", etc would be easy to vectorize and give a modest speedup
2. Once calculations are using vectors rather than Boid objects, even if not fully vectorized, Numba JIT would likely give a massive speedup
3. Optimize perlin code. Either a separate thread that sends the perlin noise to some shared resource, or rewrite in NP and use Numba decorators
3. Writing certain modules in C or using cPython could provide further marginal benefits

Roadmap:
1. Completely remove deep copy and instead pass arrays of positions, directions, and indexes to boids. This sets framework for:
2. Vectorize distance calculation. Avoiding overhead from looping and inefficient cache access should be a massive boost
3. Vectorize other calculations. The speedup will be mild because these operations are already fast, but by vectorizing everything I can:
4. Implement Numba. Numba decorators do JIT compilation for operations with NP arrays, which could unironically run 1000x faster
5. Once performance is sufficient at a reasonable simulation scale, I can look into sending the frames over websocket to a local HTML page
